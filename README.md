## Supervised Learning
The goal of the first task was to classify a dataset containing 500 predictors (p), 1000 observations (n) into two classes (0 and 1) based on the training data provided where n=400. No description or information regarding the data was provided.

## Unsupervised Learning
An unlabelled data set consisting of 1000 observations and 784 predictors was provided and the objective was to obtain an optimal value of groups or clusters. Once again, no information was provided regarding the source or subject of the data.
